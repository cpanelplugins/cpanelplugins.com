This plugin was developed for an article on my site PCx3.com titled [How to Create a cPanel Plugin.](https://pcx3.com/cp/how-to-create-a-cpanel-plugin/)

When we find malicious code on a user’s website, we scan his files with a plugin such as ImunifyAV and check .lastlogin file for any suspicious IP addresses that have been reported in the AbuseIP database. </br>

This plugin streamlines the process by allowing both SysAdmins and cPanel users to quickly view file content and check IPs in the AbuseIPDB.

The .lastlogin file from each user's home directory, which contains the last 20 Cpanel logins, is output as a table by this plugin.
