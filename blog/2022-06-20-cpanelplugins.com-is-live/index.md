cpanelplugins.com website is a fork of Gridsome.org and is hosted on netlify.

I created this website as an alternative to Cpanel AppCatalog because it hasn't been updated in years and of you want to submit a plugin, their review process takes weeks.

The website creates a plugin page for each github repo added inside plugins.yaml file

Hopefully cpanelplugins.com will soon also include other peoples plugins as well, and not just my own. 😄
